# Infinite Trivia!

Originally built to the specifications in a Figma design document provided by Scrimba.com as part of their React course. From there, extended the application in a variety of ways to make it more usable, interesting, and robust. No code was provided by Scrimba. Every line of code was written by me, with the exception of the CSS to make the logo on the front screen, which was adapted from an online resource.
